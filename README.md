# RGames
Here are some games I wrote in R just for personal interest.

Currently there is only 1 game. But I do hope to add some more interesting games written in R.

The GuessNumber is inspired by my classmate Moye Li. It's a guess-number game which somehow like the guess-word game 'hangman'. But in my game there isn't any drawing of a man being hanged and you can keep guessing until you get it right.

You can set and play the game all by yourself. And I also provide a very rudimentary AI.
