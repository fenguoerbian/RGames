# RGames
Here are some games I wrote in R just for personal interest. I believe most of the games you find here will be the games you have seen or played elsewhere. Truth be told, I don't invent games. I just take this project as an excercise both for my R programming and English writing.

[**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Some one says that whenever a statistic paper is finished, a corresponding R package is developped. But R can do more than that. I once read [a blog about how to write a 2048 game in R](http://blog.fens.me/r-game-2048/) and that was very impressive for me. Recently I use R to control [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to convert large amount of video and/or audio streams. 

You can see this project as a simple demonstration of what R can do in entertainment. You can also see it as a sparking point to attract/impress someone about what R can do. To me, this project is for fun, enjoyment, and a self-test.

Currently there is only 1 game. I'm very lazy but I do hope to add some more interesting games written in R.

## GuessNumber
The GuessNumber game is inspired by my classmate Moye Li. It's a guess-number game which somehow like the guess-word game 'hang-man'. But in my game there isn't any drawing of a man being hanged and you can keep on guessing until you get it right.

You can set and play the game all by yourself. And I also provide a very rudimentary AI.

My girlfriend Lin Shuai is the one and only beta tester. Although she thought this game is stupid, she made some valid suggestions. For instance, she demands a graphical interface which is currently out of my reach. Later I will consider adding this feature.

## Tic Tac Tou
The up-coming game will be the retro tic tac tou. I did write one in C when I learnt that language according to the classic textbook *Beginning C: From Novice to Professional*. I suppose it wouldn't be very difficult to write an R version of it. 

Currently there's no design for an AI programe in this game, because originally I only write the 2-player part of the game. But I'll consider to add a simple AI in it so that one can play the game.

## More to come, I hope.
